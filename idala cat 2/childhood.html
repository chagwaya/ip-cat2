           <h3>Early childhood experiences</h3>
           <p>
                I grew up in an area where violence and crime scenes were more often done but i was led by 
                very loving and caring parents. I was shown the right ways to do things and they made sure i was indulge in giving my life to christ.
                I was also taken to one of the best schools so that my knowledge and skills were at the best.
           </p>

           <h3>Family interactions</h3>
           <p>   
               Growing up in ghetto areas requires the parents attention to ensure ones child is in the safest path.
               My parents were always there for me and they always made sure i got to know my other relatives so at holidays we would visit my grandmother where we would held a family gathering and i got to know my best relatives.
               i got to know everyone and given advise by our elder members. 
           </p>

           <h3>Formative moments</h3>
           <p>
                Moreover, I have done mistakes in my childhood, but by my family mentorship it has lead to significant growth and self-discovery. I learnt how to overcoming challenges, 
                achieving goals, and learning from mistakes. This contributed to the development of positive personality traits, such as perseverance, determination, and resilience.
                Decision making was one of the hardest things i had to encounter everyday.
